        	<p> Scandals. Corruption. Plagiarism. Indictment. That's the stuff of a good story. In the summer of 2012, it was also the stuff of what Princeton professor Kim Lane Scheppele calls a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/guest-post-romania-unravels-the-rule-of-law/">Romanian "political crisis" </a>.</p>

			<p>The short story is that amidst allegations from the left-leaning Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_presidential_impeachment_referendum,_2012">referendum</a> was held to impeach President Basescu for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18742734">abusing his power and interfereing in government business</a>. The real story is, of course, much more complex. With heavy charges of corruption and abuse on both sides, a flurry of critique, campaigns and protest erupted, both in the streets and Internet sphere. </p>

			<p>To better understand how these debates were perceived by Romanians, we looked to memes we found on Facebook, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/romania">Reddit</a> and Google to make sense of what was going on in June-August 2012. We categorized the memes that we found in five main groups: Ponta vs. Basescu, Appealing to International Support, Citizenship and Voting/Anti-Voting Campaigns, Ponta's Plagiarism Scandal, and Basescu's Impeachment Vote. We chose to categorize these by the main threads of discussion.  </p>

			<p>
					The critics of Victor Ponta, Romania's left-leaning Prime Minister, argued that Ponta was unjustified in his attempt to remove President Basescu from office. Ponta had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/world/europe/romania-parliament-votes-to-impeach-traian-basescu.html">dismissed the speakers of both chambers of the Romanian parliament, threatened the constitutional court judges with impeachment, and prohibited the constitutional court from reviewing acts of parliamenti</a>. Ponta's supporters accused Basescu of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/30/romania-impeachment-vote-fails">employing the country's secret service against his rivals</a> and several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Romanian_political_crisis#Motives_invoked_for_suspension">violations of the constitutioni</a> were cited as reasons for impeachment.</p>

			<p>Both leaders' supporters and critics reacted to the allegations by starting smear campaigns and referencing cultural figures to gain popular support. In the memes, we found themes of fighting, accusations of dictatorship, and heroism. The leaders were depicted in the likes of Lenin, a gladiator, musketeer, the pope, Gandalf (Lord of the Rings), Die Hard, Chuck Norris, and James Bond, among others. </p>

			<p>	

			When portraying the leaders, memes appealed to notions of "the West" and "the East". By and large, Romanians aim to be categorized as "Western". Both Ponta and Basescu catered to that narrative. Memes showed German Chancellor Angela Merkel's resting her hand on the shoulders of Basescu. In contrast, the words "Basescu Impeached. Not Bad" are written beneath the image of an approving President Obama. Russia and "the East" were made into rather embarrassing friends. Ponta is placed into a heroic image of Lenin and frequently referenced together with Putin and Russia.

			On July 4th, Ponta's parliamentary majority brought an indictment against the president, which had to be approved in a popular referendum before it could take effect. The Romanian Constitution requires a referendum to have at least 50% voter participation in order to be validated. Whereas various organizations encouraged citizens to vot, playing on notions of democracy and citizenship, President Basescu started an anti-voting campaign. Polls showed that a majority of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19034173">87.5% of voters favored Basescu's impeachment. However, there was only a 46% voter turnout, thus deeming the referendum invalid. </a>

			<h3> Impeach Basescu? </h3>
			<p> Many of the pictures encouraging Basescu's impeachment were found on Reddit. These images have a more of the classical meme aspect that is shared through memes like the ones on <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/Ponta/?upcoming">Quick Meme</a>, <a href=http://www.memecenter.com/fun/500848/our-copy-paste-romanian-prime-minister-victor-ponta">Meme Center</a> or <a href="memegenerator.net/instance/22279051">Meme Generator</a>.

			Prime Minister Ponta was ridiculed by both sides when it became clear that <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/romanian-panel-calls-prime-minister-a-plagiarist-1.10926">85 of his 307-page dissertation on the international criminal court had been cut and paste from the work of others. Moreover, the master's degree he claimed on his CV turned out to be a hoax. Ponta never received it.</a> He gained the reputation of being the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/07/romanian-politics">Copy Paste Prime Minister</a>. Memes called Ponta "Mr. Copy Paste", a reptile, "disquotationalist", "Plagiator" "Idiot", "Ctrl + V" and even compared him to Lenin. These memes started spreading two weeks before the referendum.

			<h3> Reflections: Memes & Reporting</h3>
		</div>
	 </div>


     <div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<p>
			<strong>What makes an image a meme?</strong>: 
			When categorizing and coding the memes we encountered several challenges: how do we separate memes from mere PR and other images? When does an image become a meme? Do we look mainly to the source, to how quickly the image spread? What’s the cutoff? How can we easily and quickly tell?
			</p>

			<p>
			<strong>Escaping "filter bubbles" to build a complete meme stream:</strong> Our own "filter bubbles" made it difficult to find memes from both sides: Prime Minister Ponta supporters, President Basescu supporters and critics. In 2012, the memes and images were saved from one person's Facebook feed, but most only told one side of the story. We then searched Reddit and Google to find morememes. In writing this story, we wondered what other "meme-gathering" platforms could help us best escape the filter bubble: Storify? Or perhaps Facebook's new graph search? other online communities? is there an automated way to create a stream of memes describing an event? 
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Language and cultural subtleties:</strong>: 
			Most of the memes contain cultural subtleties and are in Romanian. With a Romanian background, having lived in "the East" and "the West", we were (still with some difficulties) able to make out the meme texts and certain cultural subtleties. We wondered what tools could help us, and how journalists and outsiders of the cultural background, could best go about encrypting and explaining memes to broad audiences. Google translator and image search (especially Google's "view similar images" feature) were helpful. But if we had been forced to rely only on these, most of the memes would have been lost on us. Thus, for reporters and public without access to international outlets explaining a situation, this story would have been difficult to report on. However, the cultural subtleties of the memes can bring an additional layer of storytelling to the events they are presenting
